# **Data Cleaning in MySQL for Layoff Dataset**

## **Overview**
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and scripts for cleaning and preparing a layoff dataset using MySQL. Layoff datasets often contain various inconsistencies, missing values, and errors that need to be addressed before performing any meaningful analysis. The provided scripts offer a step-by-step approach to clean the data efficiently, ensuring its reliability and accuracy for further analysis.

## **Dataset Description**
The layoff dataset used in this project comprises information about layoffs from multiple companies, including details such as the company name, date of layoff, affected employees, and reasons for the layoff. While this dataset holds valuable insights, it also exhibits common data quality issues, including duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting, and missing values.

## **Data Cleaning Process**

**Data Exploration**: We begin by exploring the dataset to understand its structure, identify potential issues, and gain insights into the data distribution.<br>
**Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are a common issue in datasets and can significantly impact analysis results. We employ various techniques, such as imputation or removal, to handle missing values appropriately.<br>
**Dealing with Duplicates**: Duplicate entries can skew analysis results and should be addressed. We detect and remove duplicate records to ensure data integrity.<br>
**Standardizing Formats**: Inconsistent formatting of data, such as dates or company names, can make analysis challenging. We standardize formats to ensure consistency across the dataset.<br>
**Correcting Errors**: Data entry errors and inconsistencies are corrected to improve the accuracy of the dataset. This includes fixing typos, reconciling conflicting information, and validating data against external sources where applicable.<br>
**Data Transformation**: Data may need to be transformed or aggregated to facilitate analysis. We perform necessary transformations, such as calculating metrics or aggregating data at different levels, to prepare the dataset for analysis.
